<h1>Preparation</h1>
<body>
  <p>There are many different ways and styles to prepare a meal. While some ways to prepare a meal include cooking or spreading some peanut butter <br/>
  and jelly, there are much more complex ways that require more steps and a lot more effort.</p>
  <h2>Cooking</h2>
  <p>Cooking is one of the most common ways to prepare a meal. You just need to get the necessary food items, mix them together, and put them in a pot or pan <br/>
  to heat them up to a point of making the flavors blend and taste good.</p>
  <p>Cooking is also done in many different styles according to where in the world it is being done. Like in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thailand</li>
      <li>France</li>
      <li>India</li>
      <li>And Many More</li>
    </ul>
<p>All of these different cuisines have the same goal to produce some food that is tasty and good to eat. They also all use spices to bring out flavors in <br/>
  unique meals. <p/>
  <br/>
<p>More specifically, Thai food is generally known for how spicy it is. The chefs mix their ingredients with many different spices in order to make it unique and delicious.<br/>
  French chefs use different style like sautéing or déglacer. Sautéing is when the chef cooks the food at a high temperature in some fat like butter<br/>
  or fat in general. Déglacer is when the chef you add liquid to the bottom of the pan to bring out the flavor and make yourself your own sauce. Just like Thai food, Indian chefs use <br/>
  a lot of different spices to bring out different tastes. Some Indian cuisines cotain the spices of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cinnamon</li>
    <li>coriander</li>
    <li>ginger</li>
    <li>cumin</li>
    <br/>
