<h1>Presentation</h1>
<p>Presentation is important to food when you are trying to make the product look appetizing or photogenic. Restaurants usually try to make <br/>
  their dishes have a good presentation on their menus in order to attract customers to buy that certain dish or dishes. Not only do restaurants <br/>
  use presentation to their advantage, but so do bakeries. While there may be different intentions between the two, each of them rely on this aspect<br/>
  to attract their customers and make them buy it.</p>
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
  <p>As said before, restaurants try to perfect their presentation in order to persuade customers. However, they also try to consistently make their<br/>
    meals have a good presentation in order to get good ratings on yelp and have a good reputation.Some chefs in restaurants take pride in their cooking and<br/>
  only expect the best from themselves, which includes the quality of the meal, theq quality of the ingredients used, and the presentation itself.</p>

  <h2>Bakeries</h2>
  <p>Just like Restaurants, Bakeries want to have a good prepartation in order to sell the item. While this may be true, most bakers take the time<br/>
  to put a lot of effort and havea good presentation for pride. Bakeries aren't as rushed as Restaurants, so they are able to take the necessary <br/>
  time to put in a lot of effort to make their cakes or pastries look nice and presentable.</p>
  <p>One bakery that runs of family and pride is <a href="http://www.carlosbakery.com/" target="_blank">Carlo's Bake Shop</a>. Carlo's Bake Shop is commonly<br/>
    known for its famous cakes with lots of detail and taste in general. Carlo's Bake Shop has been going on since 1910, making it over 100 years old! The bakery <br/>
    also has a TV show on TLC called "Cake Boss". This televised program is about how Buddy (the owner) and his team are put up with impossible requests for parties<br/>
    and create a cake so spectacular that it makes you not want to eat it because of its beauty.</p>
